Hi,

my name is Tadej. I come from Slovenia, a small but beautiful country 
in southern central Europe, bordering to Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia. Above you can see [Vipava Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipava_Valley) and my home town, [Ajdovscina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajdov%C5%A1%C4%8Dina).

I'm 26 and I earn my living by writing code. I'm knees deep in mobile development and while my flagship is Android, I'm constantly flirting with iOS too. 

I currently live in Dublin, where I work for the biggest poker company in the world. Our apps attract
thousands of people every day. This means we're constantly on our toes, juggling between new features, 
bug fixes and code speedups. 

When I'm not working, I try very hard to keep myself away from computers (which is sometimes way too hard) and enjoy other things in life. I love sports, reading and travelling. Of Mice and Men is definitely one of my favorites books and some my favorite places include New Zealand, Zermatt, Sydney, New York and of course London.
