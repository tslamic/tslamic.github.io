Hi,

my name is Tadej. I come from Slovenia, a small but beautiful country 
in southern central Europe, bordering to Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia. Above you can see [Vipava Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipava_Valley) and my home town, [Ajdovscina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajdov%C5%A1%C4%8Dina).

I'm 28 and I earn my living by writing code. I'm knees deep in mobile development and while my flagship is Android, I'm constantly flirting with iOS, Xamarin and other frameworks for creating cool mobile apps.

I currently live in London, where I work for one of the biggest consultancy companies in the UK. Working with startups with only a handful of customers, a multi-billion international financial institutions or government agencies, my work is never boring.

When I'm not working, I try very hard to keep myself away from computers, which is sometimes way too hard, and enjoy other things in life. I love sports, reading, travelling and enjoying great food. Of Mice and Men is definitely one of my favorites books and some my favorite places include New Zealand, Norway, Zermatt, Sydney, New York and, obviously, London.
