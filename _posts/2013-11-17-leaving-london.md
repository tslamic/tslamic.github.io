About a year ago, I bought a one way ticket to London.

I had a job waiting for me and all I had to do was to show up. Until then, I was sure the place I was living in is a slow-paced, boring and futureless town that will never become a city. I wanted to get out.

After buying the ticket, reality kicked in. I became sentimental and hesitant. I'm leaving my family. I'm leaving my friends. The place I grow up in, the forests, mountains and fresh air.  Mom's dishes and nagging. Soccer after work and drinks in my favourite bar. The smell of freshly cut grass. The sun. Half an hour drive either to the snowy slopes or good enough beach.

It sure isn't the most opportunistic and ambitious little town. But it's _home_.

It was cold when I landed in Stansted. Looking through the dirty train window, I was petrified. Will I blend in with the new coworkers? Will I be up to the task?

It all turned out great. Friendly, talkative and cool coworkers from all over the world. Different language and environment. I was put out of my comfort zone. While easing in, I was learning, progressing and evolving. I became more confident in my knowledge and the code I wrote. I learned to use new tools and adopted new practices. Cut down the buzzwords when talking to non-tech people. I stopped waving my hands all the time. Do presentations!

One thing I picked up is for certain. You can never _learn_ and _know_ enough. Not only from books, articles and smart people - you can learn from _anyone_. Just pay attention and be open minded. Always think about the advice you are given, however stupid or useless you think it is. And _never_ judge a book by its covers. Literally and metaphorically.

I miss home. But I have grown as a person and that alone has made the move worthy. I learned. Experienced. And I don't want to stop doing that. That's why I'm leaving. I just started my new job in Dublin. I'm scared, but eager to learn.
