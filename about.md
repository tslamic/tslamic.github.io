Hi,

my name is Tadej and I'm the author of this blog. I come from Slovenia, a small but beautiful country 
in southern central Europe, bordering to Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia.

I'm 25 and I'm earning my living by writing code. For the last few years, I'm knees deep in mobile development.
While my flagship is Android, I'm constantly flirting with iOS too. 

I currently live in Dublin, where I work for the biggest poker company in the world. Our apps attract
thousands of people every day. This means we're constantly on our toes, juggling between new features, 
bug fixes and code speedups. 

When I'm not working, I try very hard to keep myself away from the computer and enjoy other things in life. I love sports and I spend at least an hour a day sweating, be it in the gym, running outside or doing Insanity at home. I also enjoy reading. Of Mice and Men is definitely one of my favorites. 

I've traveled quite a bit too. The only continent I'm
yet to set foot to (excluding Antarctica) is South America. Some of my favorite places are 
Queenstown (New Zealand), Zermatt, Sydney, New York and of course London. 

I'll tell you more if you write to me. My email is <br/ >

I look forward hearing from you!
