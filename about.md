My name is Tadej. Iâ€™m from [Slovenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia), a small, beautiful country in central Europe, bordering to Italy, Austria, Hungary, and Croatia. Here's how you pronounce my name:

My hometown, [Ajdovscina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajdov%C5%A1%C4%8Dina), lies in the heart of [Vipava Valley](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/slovenia/vipava-valley), a top 10 travel destination according to [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/best-in-europe).

Growing up, I was a keen basketball player and a member of the Slovenian national team in freestyle snowboarding. Nowadays, I write code for a living, which is less exciting.

I spent a few years in Dublin and London. I currently live in Oslo. When not sitting in front of a computer, I love to run, cross-country ski, travel and read.
